# CoinRally

### Introduction
Few games have developed on virtual reality as compared to 2-D games. We chose to develop a VR-based Car game named Coin Rally. You (player) have to collect coins on a track while collecting the coins obstacles (in the form of cars) will be there on the track and you have to dodge them. Your position on the leaderboard will be based on the coins collected. Moreover,  the collected coins can be used to unlock new cars. Usually, VR gadgets are costly. So, we are going to develop this game that can be played using VR cardboard which is far cheaper than VR gadgets.
